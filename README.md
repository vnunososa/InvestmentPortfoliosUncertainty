# InvestmentPortfoliosUncertainty
Thesis to reach degree in Math Engineering: Uncertainty caused by resampling in the investment portfolios

The Jupyter Notebook: TesisDataFrames contains the functions to read data (stock prices of an investment portfolio), transform to get the daily prices logarithms, solve the optimal portfolio problem by Markowitz Method and the resampling functions to export the parameters distributions given the experiments. The process is repeated for portfolios with three, six, nine, twelve and fifteen assets, the methodology is the same for all.

The Jupyter Notebooks: Conclusions, are showing the final histograms and the confidence intervals to assert and prove the established hypothesis at the beginning, that is the diversification technique and biggest samples are helping us to avoid the uncertainty on the gotten parameters after the investments.

Also I share with you the thesis in a PDF to show the math / statistical theory in back of this simulation excersise to prove the raised hypothesis
